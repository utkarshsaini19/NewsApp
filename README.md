# NewsApp
Here is the news app with infinite loading functionality

Site is live at :- snazzy-bombolone-f418fe.netlify.app

But it has news api key and that only runs on localhost.

Just create a .env.local file and assign your api key to REACT_APP_NEWS_API variable thats all .

Your app will now run on your localhost.
